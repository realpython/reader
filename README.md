    # How to Publish an Open-Source Python Package to PyPI

    Python is famous for coming with batteries included. Sophisticated
    capabilities are available in the standard library. You can find modules for
    working with sockets, parsing CSV, JSON, and XML files, and working with
    files and file paths.

    However great the packages included with Python are, there are many
    fantastic projects available outside the standard library. These are most
    often hosted at the Python Packaging Index (PyPI), historically known as the
    Cheese Shop. At PyPI, you can find everything from Hello World to advanced
    deep learning libraries.
